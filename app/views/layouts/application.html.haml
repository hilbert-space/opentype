          Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken,
          but you happen to pull this shit while I’m in a transitional period
          so I don’t wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can’t give you
          this case, it don’t belong to me. Besides, I’ve already been through
          too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your
          dumb ass.

          You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has
          a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for
          murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I
          don’t know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that
          seven of us survived the slide… and only five made it out. Now we
          took an oath, that I’m breaking now. We said we’d say it was the snow
          that killed the other two, but it wasn’t. Nature is lethal but it
          doesn’t hold a candle to man.

          My money’s in that office, right? If she start giving me some
          bullshit about it ain’t there, and we got to go someplace else and
          get it, I’m gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I’m
          gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn
          money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I’m talking to
          you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston
          or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot.
          You understand?

          Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag
          clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little
          Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a
          mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No?
          Well, that’s what you see at a toy store. And you must think you’re
          in a toy store, because you’re here shopping for an infant named Jeb.

          Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami.
          This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime.
          Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book
          that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like
          they’re actually proud of that shit.
